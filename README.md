# Hello DevOps
A simple "hello world" web application made using Docker, PHP 8 and MySQL. The application is a JSON API that politely tells if the database connection is working.

# Local Installation
1. Modify and copy `.env.example` as `.env`
2. Run `docker-compose up`
3. Open http://localhost:8080

# Task
Deploy the application using tools of your own choosing and document the process. An example stack could include:
- AWS EC2 or ECS
- AWS RDS MySQL
- Terraform

The documentation should have enough information for another DevOps engineer to replicate the environment.

**Note:** You don't necessarily have to keep the servers running. You can use free tier AWS or similar.
